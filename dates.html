Nine persons have been present. Markus presented a brainteaser: There are twelve coins of equal weight
except one of them that has a different weight. We don't know if it is lighter or heavier. It's just
different! With scales you have three guesses to find out which one is the offending coin. Is there
a solution? If yes, what is it?

Eleven persons were present at this meeting. As it was very nice sitting outside
at Max Emanuel Brauerei, we will meet theire again next time. It's summer!
</br>

This time, we left our high level functional view
and had a hands on demonstration by Raman of an embedded C-interpreter on an ARM Cortex board.
Nice work! Maybe, someday we could try to do something with 
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom/" target="_blank">atom</a>,
a Haskell DSL for designing hard realtime embedded software? Look also

Maybe due to the simultaneous football match, this time only six persons were present.
Nevertheless, it was really nice at Max Emanuel Brauerei and we easily found a good

Once again, some good links were sent. Thanks to Kai for the link to the
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/" target="_blank">
Z3 Theorem Proofer</a>. He used it for his academic research to do type checking. He also
provided a link to <a href="http://opalang.org/" target="_blank">Opa</a> which is an affectionate way
in German to say grandfather. In fact, it's an statically typed application
framework for JavaScript in which one can write frontend (client), backend (server), database 
and configuration code all in the same file. The compiler then boils it down to the
appropriate structure.
<br/>
For those who like it difficult, many thanks to Thomas, beause he
he provided the link to
<a href="http://www.lscheffer.com/malbolge.shtml" target="_blank">Malbolge</a>.
If you are tired now from reading Malbolge code, because it's not
function, then take a look at
<a href="http://www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/#intro" target="_blank">Unlambda</a>. 
That should make you sleep well.
<br/>
Last but not least, we want to mention
<a href="http://iba-cg.de/hal7.html" target="_blank">HaL-7</a>, a Haskell workshop in Halle.

This time, we were nine persons, not all of which had a computer science background: We
also had a typographer amongst us. We had to explain the
ideas of functional programming from the scratch. Interestingly, this was
quite a controversy!
<br/>
Other talks ranged from high level programming to low level circuitry.
First, we want to draw your attention to 
<a href="http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/Clean" target="_blank">Clean</a>. If you
thought about programming a purly lazy functional language other than Haskell,
you should definitly check it out. 
<a href="http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/index.html" target="_blank">Mercury</a>
seems to draw its ideas more from the logic side of declarative programming. If you
want to bridge the gap between functional and logic programming, maybe the
<a href="http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/currywiki/" target="_blank">Curry</a>
language is for you.
<br/>
As to circuitry, two commercially failing processors were discussed: The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_iAPX_432" target="_blank">Intel iAPX 432</a>
and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_i860" target="_blank">Intel i860</a>.
Last, but not least, the 
<a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6334" target="_blank">SCHEME-79 Chip</a>
does not seem to have had more success.
<br/>
Finally, if you want to go all the way from high level to low level, you might
want to have a look at
<a href="http://raintown.org/lava/" target="_blank">Lava</a> which is a hardware
description language embedded in Haskell.
<br/>
Thanks to Thomas and Christian for sending all these links! We hope you will
<a href="http://picturesforsadchildren.com/post/22145925135" target="_blank">enjoy</a> them!
<br/>
One adminstrative point at the end: We decided to meet next time at
<a href="http://www.max-emanuel-brauerei.de" target="_blank">Max Emanuel Brauerei</a>.
Please be aware of this change, if you plan to join next time.

Below you can see a picture of our <font color="#990000">hackathon</font> 
which took place at LMU
in Munich. Many thanks to Christian for organising the venue, as well
as soft drinks and coffee. And of course, he took the picture!
<br/>
The event was very nice and well received. A total of 16 persons was
present. We started with a short introduction round at 10h30. Many
thanks to Andreas who wrote a protocol listing participants
and their respective activities! After that,
we heard four talks. Topics
were <em>integer sequences, equation solver optimisation,
Game Boy emulation with arrows</em>, and the
<em>HyperLogLog algorithm</em>.
<br/>
After a sandwich break, we started hacking until 18h00, which
was, alas, much to short! We concluded the day dining in a nearby
restaurant. Many thanks to all who took part. For all those who
could not take part this time, we think about renewing this
event later this year. Also think about joining us in our
regular get-togethers.

For our April meeting, 14 people registered, and around this number also showed up.

<br/>
This time again, some interesting links were sent. First, Marc sent links about the
functional programming language
<a href="http://impredicative.com/ur/" target="_blank">Ur</a>. Together with a special
library, Ur seems well suitet for those wanting to create web applications. Marc also
provided a link to <a href="http://nixos.org/" target="_blank">Nixos</a>, a
Linux based OS, that comprises a purly functional package manager. It allows for
upgrading a package without breakin another, rolling back a system, and multiple
package versions on the same system.
<br/>
Last, but not least, Andreas provided a link to
<a href="http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/" target="_blank">Certified Programming

Implementors Workshop and explained some of the ideas of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type" target="_blank">dependent types</a> in programming.

Markus send a link to a cool Haskell tool,
namly <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1178" target="_blank">Djinn</a>,

Nine persons attended our first meeting in 2012. This time again, it was nice to see newcomers next to already known people. We
want to ecourage everyone to join once in a while!
<br/>
Reinhard sent a link to the online encyclopedia of integer sequences (<a href="https://oeis.org" target="_blank">OEIS</a>)
for which he is doing spare time research. Specifying <em>program:Haskell</em> in the search form will result in a list
of sequences for which Haskell definitions are given. Look for example at
